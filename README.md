\\ PAGING TECHNIQUE OF MEMORY MANAGEMENT


 In computer operating systems, paging is one of the memory management schemes by
which a computer stores and retrieves data from the secondary storage for use in main memory.
In the paging memory-management scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary
storage in same-size blocks called pages. Paging is a memory-management scheme that permits
the physical address space a process to be noncontiguous. The basic method for implementing
paging involves breaking physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called frames and breaking
logical memory into blocks of the same size called pages. When a process is to be executed, its
pages are loaded into any available memory frames from their source. Write a program to
simulate paging technique of memory management.
